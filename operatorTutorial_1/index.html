        <h3>Assignment operators</h3>
        <p>An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Assignment</h4>
        <p>Simple assignment operator which assigns a value to a variable. The assignment operation evaluates to the assigned value. Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to assign a single value to multiple variables. See the example.</p>
        <p>Syntax</p>

        <code>Operator: x = y</code>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <code>
            // Assuming the following variables <br>
            //  x = 5 <br>
            //  y = 10 <br>
            //  z = 25 <br>
            <br>
            x = y     // x is 10 <br>
            x = y = z // x, y and z are all 25
        </code>
